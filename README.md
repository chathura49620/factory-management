Project Description
The Factory Management System (FMS) is a computerized management and manufacturing system that automates task distribution from detailers to production managers and all the way down to the factory floor. It is a usable system for factories that need to manage production, order placements, store management, wholesale purchase and many more. The system basically features a set of common functions that any factory desires and implements a solution for working companies and factories to be able to manage their daily statistics. The system also gives the ability for wholesale buyers, employees and users to carry out their daily tasks via the system, without having to be present at the factory while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ahead.

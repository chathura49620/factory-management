# Project Description 
The Factory Management System (FMS) is a computerized management and manufacturing system that automates task distribution from detailers to production managers and all the way down to the factory floor. It is a usable system for factories that need to manage production, order placements, store management, wholesale purchase and many more. The system basically features a set of common functions that any factory desires and implements a solution for working companies and factories to be able to manage their daily statistics. The system also gives the ability for wholesale buyers, employees and users to carry out their daily tasks via the system, without having to be present at the factory while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ahead.<br/><br/>

Through our integrated web application system, it will initially provide four main functionalities, depending on the priority. Each functionality will play an important role to create, retrieve, analyse data and generate accurate results.  Listed below are the four main functionalities:<br/><br/>
●	Store and Profile Management
●	Employee Management
●	 Admin and financial management
●	 Wholesale buyer and production management<br/><br/>

1. The Store and profile management is the initial stage where the factory purchases the system, and is allowed access to all of the functions, hence creating a factory profile with relevant factory details. The factory owner is instantly appointed as the Super Administrator of the web application, where he will be able to manage and approve any related queries coming forward in the system. The admin is also allowed to create, edit, and delete stores that make contracts for supply with the factory, and be able to generate reports of the information.<br/><br/>

2. The Employee Management deals with the profiles of the employees and workers for the factory, where they will possess an account with their user details and log into the system. The employee section will have a dashboard, where the employee is able to clock-in and clock-out, manage their profile, add and update daily reports of their workload and submit for approvals to the admin. The employee is also allowed to request for leaves, submit issues or complaints, be able to track their monthly salary record, and generate reports of their daily work and dispatched salary breakdown at the end of the month.<br/><br/>

3. The admin and financial management will be fully functional to the admin himself, where he will have access to factory categories, product information, user access and reports. The admin has the ability to add, edit and remove employees from the system, generate reports of employee progress, approve supplier chains and manage product details via the system. The admin is also able to view the financial records of the factory, such as costs, profits and losses, and sales management, update accounts, delete financial records and generate monthly/yearly records of the information.<br/><br/>

4. The Wholesale buyer and production management allows any company chains who are in contract with the factory, manage orders and returns, add/update and delete product listings, search products category vice, and manage their profile as well. The buyer is allowed to place an order via the system, and the production manager will approve of the order request and carry out the order process. If there are any returns, the wholesale buyer can make a request via the system, and the production manager will approve of it. Wholesale buyers can manage and edit their profile on the system as well. The admin will be able to look into wholesale order progress as well, and dispatch the order to the buyer, generating invoices and reports of the completed order.<br/><br/>

The system is expected to organize the factory activities and help management in decision making tasks. It is also expected to cut down costs of the factory and increase the profitability of any company making a contract thus creating a much more reliable and convenient web application system.<br/><br/>
